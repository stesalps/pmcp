# Google Manus System

A comprehensive AI assistant system that leverages Google's local models in Colab for code generation, execution, research, and web deployment, with human-in-the-loop capabilities.

## Overview

The Google Manus System is a powerful, modular AI assistant designed to run in Google Colab notebooks. It combines the capabilities of Google's local models (Gemini, Gemma) with a robust tool system, code execution environment, and human review workflow.

## Key Features

- **Local Model Integration**: Uses Google's Colab AI models with fallback to Ollama
- **Code Generation & Execution**: Write, review, test, and execute code
- **Research Capabilities**: Search, summarize, and organize information
- **Web Deployment**: Launch websites with FRP tunneling
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Review and approve AI-generated responses
- **Extensible Tool System**: Easily add new capabilities

## System Architecture

The system is organized into six modular "boxes" that can be run sequentially:

### Box 1: Environment Setup and Configuration
- System initialization
- Directory structure setup
- Configuration management
- Dependency installation

### Box 2: Model Integration and Core Services
- Google model integration (Gemini, Gemma)
- Ollama model integration (fallback)
- Model selection and configuration
- Memory system for conversation history

### Box 3: Tool Registry and Execution Framework
- Tool registration system
- File system operations
- Code execution and review
- Research and deployment tools

### Box 4: User Interface and Interaction
- Jupyter widgets interface
- Chat interface
- Task execution interface
- Tool execution interface
- Code editor interface

### Box 5: Web Deployment and External Services
- FastAPI server setup
- FRP tunnel integration
- Static file serving
- Web-based code execution environment

### Box 6: Human-in-the-Loop System
- Human review interface
- Message queue management
- Response approval workflow
- Confidence threshold configuration

## Available Tools

### File System Tools
- `write_file`: Create or update files
- `read_file`: Read file contents
- `list_files`: List directory contents
- `search_files`: Search for files by name and content

### Code Tools
- `execute_python`: Run Python code and capture output
- `review_code`: Analyze code for improvements
- `generate_tests`: Create unit tests for code
- `install_package`: Install Python packages

### Research Tools
- `search_web`: Search the web for information
- `summarize_text`: Summarize long text

### Deployment Tools
- `launch_site`: Deploy a website locally
- `setup_frp`: Configure FRP tunnel for public access

### Agent Tools
- `action_agent`: Execute complex tasks with planning
- `get_agent_memory`: Retrieve agent's memory
- `clear_agent_memory`: Reset agent's memory

## Human-in-the-Loop System

The human-in-the-loop system allows human operators to review and approve AI-generated responses before they are sent to users. This improves response quality and provides a safety mechanism for sensitive or complex queries.

### Features
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Automatically approve high-confidence responses
- **Review Interface**: Jupyter widget and web interfaces for reviewing responses
- **Response Editing**: Modify AI-generated responses before approval
- **Message Queue**: Manage pending messages awaiting review

## Web API

The system includes a FastAPI server with the following endpoints:

- `/api/chat`: Chat with the model
- `/api/chat/human-review`: Chat with human review
- `/api/tool`: Execute a tool
- `/api/task`: Execute a task
- `/api/models`: List available models
- `/api/tools`: List available tools
- `/api/reviews/pending`: Get pending reviews
- `/api/reviews/submit`: Submit a review
- `/site/launch/{site_name}`: Launch a website
- `/human-review`: Web interface for human review

## Getting Started

1. Open the `Google_Manus_System_Complete.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab
2. Run Box 1 to set up the environment
3. Run Box 2 to initialize the model system
4. Run Box 3 to set up the tool registry
5. Run Box 4 to launch the user interface
6. Run Box 5 to set up web deployment
7. Run Box 6 to enable human-in-the-loop capabilities

## Implementation Status

### Completed
- ✅ Basic system architecture and box structure
- ✅ Google model integration with Colab AI
- ✅ Ollama fallback integration
- ✅ Tool registry and execution framework
- ✅ Jupyter widget interface
- ✅ Web API with FastAPI
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop review system
- ✅ Code execution and review tools
- ✅ File system operations

### Partially Completed
- ⚠️ Web deployment with FRP (configuration only, no actual tunneling)
- ⚠️ Research tools (basic implementation, no real web search)
- ⚠️ Testing framework (basic test generation, no test execution)

### Not Implemented
- ❌ Advanced code debugging tools
- ❌ Collaborative editing features
- ❌ Advanced project management
- ❌ Version control integration
- ❌ Real-time collaboration

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Code Tools**: Add debugging, profiling, and refactoring capabilities
2. **Real Web Search**: Integrate with search APIs for actual web research
3. **Collaborative Features**: Enable multiple users to work together
4. **Version Control**: Add Git integration for code management
5. **Mobile Interface**: Create a responsive web interface for mobile devices
6. **Voice Interaction**: Add speech recognition and synthesis
7. **Custom Model Fine-tuning**: Allow users to fine-tune models for specific tasks

## Requirements

- Google Colab account
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection for initial setup
- Optional: Ollama for local model fallback
